We are a "self-help" housing co-operative: Often referred to as "short-life", we utilise properties that are unsuitable for letting for an agreed period of time, which can sometimes extend for many years. For more information please visit self-help-housing.org.

Brighton Rock is guided by the general co-operative principles: It offers members a safe environment and secure tenancy. Brighton Rock has 12 housed members, all of whom have equal rights - there is no hierarchy. Everyone is expected to attend regular monthly meetings, and is actively involved in the running, decision making, and administration of the co-op.

Everyone has their own room: Personal rooms are respected as strictly personal space. All other areas in the co-op are shared.

Brighton Rock aims to be environmentally aware: We strive to minimise our environmental impact through resource conservation and reducing waste.

The rent is set at an affordable level: This is paid in advance (from wages or benefits). Brighton Rock has a strict arrears policy which is rigorously applied.

All members contribute to the running of the co-op by taking on a job, such as maintenance coordinator, rent officer, treasurer, secretary, garden coordinator, shop keeper, and development officer. Members report on their role at the monthly meeting and the AGM.

Members are expected to attend monthly general meetings and occasional emergency meetings: These take place on weekday evenings at 7.30pm and generally last between 1 and 2 hours.

We have a co-op handbook with policies and guidelines for the safe and smooth running of the co-op. The policies and guidelines are written and reviewed by co-op members.

Members are expected to show interest and participate: This might involve occasional policy and project development groups, in addition to garden work and general maintenance workdays.

The rooms are single occupancy and can't be allocated to couples or those with children who live with them. Guests are welcome, however, if agreed by other members of the house. We also have a no pets policy although this is currently under review to allow for cats.

To balance all the hard work we also have occasional social gatherings in the houses or garden.
